# Coremark port for iMXRT 1170

CoreMark is a benchmark that measures the performance of central processing units (CPU) used in embedded systems. It was developed in 2009 by Shay Gal-On at [EEMBC](https://www.eembc.org/) and is intended to become an industry standard, replacing the Dhrystone benchmark. The code is written in C and contains implementations of the following algorithms: list processing (find and sort), matrix manipulation (common matrix operations), state machine (determine if an input stream contains valid numbers), and CRC. The code is under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and is free of cost to use, but ownership is retained by the Consortium and publication of modified versions under the CoreMark name prohibited.

This projects implements the Coremark benchmark for the [iMXRT1170]( https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/i-mx-rt-crossover-mcus/i-mx-rt1170-crossover-mcu-family-first-ghz-mcu-with-arm-cortex-m7-and-cortex-m4-cores:i.MX-RT1170) controller using [Rowley Crossworks](https://www.rowley.co.uk/). For this project the CPU-Support Package from [here](https://github.com/Masmiseim36/iMXRT) is used, as the official Port does not support the iMXRT1170 controller.
